# Codsoft_Movierecommendation

A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. This project was developed as part of the CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship and demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to provide personalized content recommendations.

üåü Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies by comparing movie attributes like genre, director, keywords, and cast.

Personalized Suggestions: Users can input a movie they like, and the system will generate a list of similar movies.

Vector-Based Similarity: Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity to find the movies that are most similar to the user's choice.

Data Preprocessing: Includes robust cleaning and preprocessing of the movie dataset to ensure accurate recommendations.

Command-Line Interface: Easy-to-use interface to get movie recommendations directly from your terminal.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn (for TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity)
